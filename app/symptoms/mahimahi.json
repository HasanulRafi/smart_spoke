        "Dengue is a viral infection transmitted to humans through the bite of infected mosquitoes.",
        "About half of the world's population is now at risk of dengue with an estimated 100-400 million infections occurring each year.",
        "Dengue is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas.",
        "While many dengue infections are asymptomatic or produce only mild illness, the virus can occasionally cause more severe cases, and even death.",
        "Prevention and control of dengue depend on vector control. There is no specific treatment for dengue/severe dengue, and early detection and access to proper medical care greatly lower fatality rates of severe dengue."

      "overview": {
        "description": "Dengue (break-bone fever) is a viral infection that spreads from mosquitoes to people. It is more common in tropical and subtropical climates.",
        "symptoms_summary": "Most people who get dengue will not have symptoms. For those who do, symptoms include high fever, headache, body aches, nausea, and rash. Most recover in 1-2 weeks. Severe cases may be fatal.",
        "treatment": "Dengue is treated with pain medicine as there is no specific treatment currently.",
        "prevention": "Avoid mosquito bites, especially during the day."

          "description": "Evidence of maternal transmission exists, though rates are low. Timing of infection during pregnancy may affect pre-term birth, low birth weight, and fetal distress."
